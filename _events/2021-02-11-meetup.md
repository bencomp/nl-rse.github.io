## Abstracts

### NWO Open Science Funds

Stephanie Holst, Programme officer at NWO, will talk about the [Open Science Fund](https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/open-science-fund-2020/2021). With this call, NWO wants to stimulate the broader adoption and implementation of Open Science by incentivizing and rewarding Open Science practices. This call aims to support researchers making research open, accessible, transparent and reusable â€“ this includes research software developed for Open Science. This call could be of interest to Research Software Engineers already using Open Science practices! Stephanie will provide more information on who can apply, what to apply for and other details of this call.

### What do DCC's mean for RSEs?

Margriet Miedema from [LCRDM](https://www.lcrdm.nl/en) will talk about the Digital Competence Centres Implementation Network. What are DCCs, why are they important for RSEs? With this talk we would like to open up a conversation and communicate with DCCs what are the challenges RSEs face and how can we work together with DCCs to find solutions to those issues.

### Software re-usability -- what is needed?

Reusability is a critical point for research software -- it is generally seen as a sign of success when a particular piece of software is reused by many users. But this is not always easy, users who come across your software may not always know what it is capable of, or find it difficult to understand how to use it.

There is a already a large collection of checklists that can be used to make sure your software meets certain quality criteria. In this session we would like to discuss: how do RSEs make sure their software is reusable?
