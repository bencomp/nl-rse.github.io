## Abstracts

### How FAIR is your software?

[*howfairis*](https://github.com/fair-software/howfairis/) is a Python package to analyze a GitHub or GitLab repository's compliance with the [FAIR software recommendations](https://fair-software.eu/).

In this session we will talk about why FAIR software is important and how to automatically test your software for compliance.

### How FAIR is your software? -- hands-on session

During this session we will focus on applying the *howfairis* Github Action to your software, to measure how compliant is your software with the FAIR software recommendations. At the end of this session, you will be able to add a badge to your GitHub repository showing to the world how fair your software is!

Prerequisite for this session is to have your software already in a Github repository.
