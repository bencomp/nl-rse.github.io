## Abstracts

### From a bash script to CWL

In modern experimental sciences, the increasing amount of data to process and the development of standardized procedures to analyze it, is driving the utilization of automatic processing pipelines.
Such pipelines combine different software components to carry out the computation.
A wide range of solutions, ranging from bash scripts to python, can be used to perform such orchestration.

In ASTRON for the European Open Science Cloud project, we chose to use the Common Workflow Language (CWL) to describe one of our standard processing pipelines.

In this demo and tutorial, we will show our experience in converting our pipeline into the CWL (v1.0) standard and our experience with the available tools to run it and visualize it. We will follow by showing you how to create a CWL step and a CWL pipeline to describe an example workflow. Finally, we will conclude the meeting with our take on why we choose CWL and why this proved to be fit to solve our problems, and we would be welcome your opinions about that.

**Our use case comes from astronomy, but this tutorial is focused on transferable skills which can be applied in other domains.**

For the tutorial, we will be using [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
please make sure that you can execute it in your browser.

If you want to run the software on your computer, you will require the following tools installed on your laptop:
 - Python 3.6 (or higher)
 - cwltool (to execute the workflow) - we recommend to use it in a virtual environment ([here](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool) is a guide on how to install it)
 - singularity/docker (in case of the software we use in the demo is not available for your system, 
 here are install instructions for [singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html)Â and [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)) -- if you are not running linux/mac we strongly suggest using google colab!

As there is not much time during the tutorial, we suggest that, if you want to run the software on your computer, you make sure that you can [run this example](https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/02-1st-example/index.html) and docker or singularity is available.
